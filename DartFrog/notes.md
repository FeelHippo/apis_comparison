// Dart Frog

- "Dart Frog can help Flutter and Dart developers maximize their productivity by having a unified tech stack"

// pros
	- ease of use
	- documentation

	- dynamic routes are easier to create and handle than Node
	- devtools
	- A single route handler is responsible for handling inbound requests with any HTTP method

	- shares a ot with FLutter, making the transition easy

// cons
	- environment variables
	- i.e. dart_frog dev --port 8090 will run the server on 8081

	- very few entires in StackOverflow even for basic issues
	- dependency hell => https://github.com/petercinibulk/envied/issues/28

	- could not find support for Swagger
